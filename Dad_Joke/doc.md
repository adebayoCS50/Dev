Title: Joke Generator API Integration

Overview:
This code fetches a random joke from an API and displays it on a webpage when a button is clicked.

Code:

Variables:

btnText: stores the DOM element of the button that triggers the API call to generate a joke.
jokeText: stores the DOM element where the generated joke will be displayed.
apiKey: stores the API key to access the API endpoint.
apiData: stores the method and header information for the API endpoint.
apiURL: stores the URL of the API endpoint.
Functions:

getJoke: an asynchronous function that fetches the joke data from the API endpoint and displays it on the webpage.

Code Flow:
The getJoke function is defined.
The btnText and jokeText DOM elements are stored in variables.
The apiKey, apiData, and apiURL variables are defined to store the necessary information for the API endpoint.
The getJoke function is called when the button is clicked, which first sets the button text to indicate that a joke is being generated, disables the button, and sets the joke text to a loading message.
The API is called using fetch, and the response data is stored in data.
The button is re-enabled and its text is changed back to the original text, and the joke is displayed in the jokeText element.
If there is an error fetching the data, the error message is displayed in the jokeText element and the button is re-enabled with the original text.
An event listener is added to the button to call the getJoke function when clicked.
